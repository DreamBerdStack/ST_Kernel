# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I can't bother with this section because why would we
not have security updates supported for every version?

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I feel like this is obvious but..

If it's a vulnerability that you (or higher-ups) believe
that it wont or rarely be exploited, just use the fucking
issues. Otherwise email rafaelandyhailu@gmail.com. It
isn't that hard.
