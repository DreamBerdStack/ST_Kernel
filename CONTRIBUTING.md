# CONTRIBUTING

This is an overall joke project so contributing isn't really too much of
concerns to me. Read on if you wish.

This kernel is written in 16-bit x86 assembly, so the code should hopefully
be pretty easy to navigate. Just if needed though, here's a description for
each directory that you (probably) will be editing in your commit:

```
boot/ - The bootloader for the ST Kernel.
docs/ - Issue and pull request templates.
```

Also, there's a little amount of tools you'll need to be able to compile and
test your code:

```
nasm
GNU make
qemu
```

Yeah.. I guess that's it. Just don't do stupid shit. - HaxeFloppa/epok_gamer/dreamberddev
